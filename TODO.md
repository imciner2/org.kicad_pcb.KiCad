# TODO

## KiCad

- [ ] Remove patch for SWIG 4.0.0 compatibility when 5.1.3 is released (it is already included upstream)
- [ ] Add in the content rating tag to the appdata.xml file and submit change to upstream
- [ ] Add in .desktop files for the internal programs other than the kicad launcher (e.g. pcbnew, gerbview, eeschema, etc.)
- [ ] Figure out licensing so that it is not marked proprietary in the software viewers
- [ ] Add in MIME type support for the KiCad file types

## Dependencies

- [ ] The explicit pathlib2 package dependency can be removed from the wxPython build when the next release of wxPython occurs.
      This has been fixed upstream already, but it will be released in the next version (4.0.7).
      See: https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/1251

- [ ] Cull out the extraneous files generated by the build processes that are not needed by kicad (e.g. tests, examples, etc.)

## General

- [ ] Convert the JSON manifest to YAML
